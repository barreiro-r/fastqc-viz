Every bioinformatician knows the feeling of seeing that first [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) report. The iconic yellow boxplot, instantly recognizable, has become a symbol of quality control in genomics. 

While FastQCâ€™s core utility remains unquestionable, its reporting interface, has somes _questionable_ design choices.

In **fastqcviz** I tried to give FastQC reports the aesthetic and functional love they deserve, transforming their insights into a more visually appealing experience without changing the core analysis.
