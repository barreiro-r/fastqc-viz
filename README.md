# FastQCviz

Every bioinformatician knows the feeling of seeing that first [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) report. The iconic yellow boxplot, instantly recognizable, has become a symbol of quality control in genomics. FastQC earned its place in history by democratizing the assessment of sequencing data quality, becoming an indispensable first step in countless analyses.

While FastQCâ€™s core utility remains unquestionable, its reporting interface, a trusted workhorse, is now ripe for a modern update.

**FastQCviz** aims to give FastQC reports the aesthetic and functional love they deserve, transforming their insights into a more visually appealing and interactive experience without changing the core analysis.
